# Compair-2-copy-unique-files

This Python script was created to help me combine my several music folders from several different computers over many years. 
The script has five veribles at the end to set the two source folders, the the destination folder. then two csv files to view files and folders that were duplicates and were not copied to the destination and another csv file of the duplicates that were not copied.

This script supports two options:

-test
to make a dry run and do not copy any files but make the two csv files to evaluate what the script will do.

-run
to accually do the coping and create the two csv files of what it did.

This is a test, and only a test for now. Use at your own risk.
